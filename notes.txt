framework for static reflection/introspection
user design reflection implementation - reduces dependies, decouples use cases for flexibility. Allows the meta structures to geow seperately from the uses
no runtime type information needed
compilation database support - no need to specify flags, include dirs, all manually
no template files or languages needed
can be run in a single pass as part of the build - no need to run generation script first, add generated includes, then compile

python or cppast depending on depencies

no dependencies on boost, etc

compared to non libclang:
unobtrusive


examples with nlohmann json and rapidjson
